# cpu-hogger
A simple program to hog all of the cpu

Build with 

    gcc cpuHog.c -o cpuHog
  
This program creates as many threads as there are available processors and then runs an infinite while loop on all of them. This was not created to be a stress test. It was created to warm my cat when it wants to sit on my laptop.
